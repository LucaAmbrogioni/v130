title: " Graphical Normalizing Flows "
abstract: " Normalizing flows model complex probability distributions by combining
  a base distribution with a series of bijective neural networks. State-of-the-art
  architectures rely on coupling and autoregressive transformations to lift up invertible
  functions from scalars to vectors. In this work, we revisit these transformations
  as probabilistic graphical models, showing they reduce to Bayesian networks with
  a pre-defined topology and a learnable density at each node. From this new perspective,
  we propose the graphical normalizing flow, a new invertible transformation with
  either a prescribed or a learnable graphical structure. This model provides a promising
  way to inject domain knowledge into normalizing flows while preserving both the
  interpretability of Bayesian networks and the representation capacity of normalizing
  flows. We show that graphical conditioners discover relevant graph structure when
  we cannot hypothesize it. In addition, we analyze the effect of $\\ell_1$-penalization
  on the recovered structure and on the quality of the resulting density estimation.
  Finally, we show that graphical conditioners lead to competitive white box density
  estimators. Our implementation is available at <https://github.com/AWehenkel/DAG-NF>. "
