title: " Online probabilistic label trees "
abstract: " We introduce online probabilistic label trees (OPLTs), an algorithm that
  trains a label tree classifier in a fully online manner without any prior knowledge
  about the number of training instances, their features and labels. OPLTs are characterized
  by low time and space complexity as well as strong theoretical guarantees. They
  can be used for online multi-label and multi-class classification, including the
  very challenging scenarios of one- or few-shot learning. We demonstrate the attractiveness
  of OPLTs in a wide empirical study on several instances of the tasks mentioned above. "
