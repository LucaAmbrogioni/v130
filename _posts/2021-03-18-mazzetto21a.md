title: " Semi-Supervised Aggregation of Dependent Weak Supervision Sources With Performance
  Guarantees "
abstract: " We develop a novel method that provides theoretical guarantees for learning from
  weak labelers without the (mostly unrealistic) assumption that the errors of the weak labelers
  are independent or come from a particular family of distributions. We show a rigorous
  technique for efficiently selecting small subsets of the labelers so that a majority
  vote from such subsets has a provably low error rate. We explore several extensions
  of this method and provide experimental results over a range of labeled data set
  sizes on 45 image classification tasks. Our performance-guaranteed methods consistently
  match the best performing alternative, which varies based on problem difficulty.
  On tasks with accurate weak labelers, our methods are on average 3 percentage points
  more accurate than the state-of-the-art adversarial method. On tasks with inaccurate
  weak labelers, our methods are on average 15 percentage points more accurate than
  the semi-supervised Dawid-Skene model (which assumes independence). "
